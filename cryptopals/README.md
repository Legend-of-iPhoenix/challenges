This is my attempt, in rust, for the challenges at https://cryptopals.com/

My solutions are grouped first by set and then by challenge, and contain test cases to validate that they work (at the very least, I test against examples provided by the challenges list, but I've also taken the liberty of writing additional test cases where appropriate).

You are forewarned that my test cases my include plain-text solutions to puzzles.
